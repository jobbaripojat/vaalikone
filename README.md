# Vaalikone
Vaalikone project for our software development module.

Modeled after Yle-vaalikone. Functionalities are basically the same as there, but with the admin side accessible. The admin can for example add, remove, and edit candidates. As well as a full list of the candidates already in the system.

Questions come from a local database, but could easily be directed to the cloud.

Commits are skewed here again because we used [Saros](https://www.saros-project.org/), an addon to Eclipse that enables multiple users to edit the same workspace using a remote connection.

The continuation to this project can be found [here](https://github.com/jobbaripojat/vaalikone2).
