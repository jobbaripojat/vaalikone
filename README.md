# Vaalikone
Vaalikone project for our software development module.

Modeled after Yle-vaalikone. Functionalities are basically the same as there, but with the added admin side. The admin can for example add new candidates, remove candidates and see a list of the candidates.

Questions come from a local database, but could easily be directed to the cloud.

Commits are skewered here again because we used Saros, an addon to Eclipse. More about Saros here: https://www.saros-project.org/
